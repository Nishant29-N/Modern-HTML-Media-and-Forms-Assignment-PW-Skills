Ques. Write a short note on tab index.

Ans.  The tabindex attribute in HTML is used to specify the order in which an element receives focus when the user presses the Tab key. 
      It can be used on any HTML element, but it is most commonly used on form elements such as input fields, buttons, and links.
      The tabindex attribute takes an integer value, and the elements with the lowest tabindex values will receive focus first. For example, if two input fields have tabindex values of 1 and 2, the input field with the tabindex value of 1 will receive focus first when the user presses the Tab key.
      The tabindex attribute can also be used to make an element non-focusable. To do this, simply set the tabindex value to -1. This is useful for elements that you do not want the user to be able to focus on, such as hidden form fields.

      Here is an example of how to use the tabindex attribute:

      <input type="text" tabindex="1">
      <input type="submit" tabindex="2">
