Ques. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.

Ans. 
    1. Structure and organize with headers
       This allows all users to easily navigate your web pages, and even improve your SEO score making it easier for you to generate more traffic to your site.
    
    2. Assign alt tags for images
       Assigning alt tags to images will provide a description of the images allowing users to understand the image through the use of a screen reader. Alt tags also contribute to a higher SEO score on Google.

    3. Use colors carefully
       Colors can help your users easily distinguish different sets of information. However, color blindness and other disabilities can make it difficult for users to find information, call-to-action buttons, or other aspects when developers fail to maintain a proper contrast of colors.
